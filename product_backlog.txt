DATA CLEANUP:
-remove ID
-Convert timestamp to numeric.  Minutes since some time x?
-remove frequency? It's targeted to stay at 50hz and doesn't vary much.
  but the documentation says a low frequency indicates higher demand than the grid
  is producing, so there might be interesting info there.



USER QUERIES:
-print the list of vars so users know what their options are
-date range in addition to single dates
-exception handling for date entry.  single digits allowable for month/day?


OUTPUT:
-summary data: not every 5 minutes but every h hours where user specifies h?
  This could be generated as a rolling average, which I'm happy to code.
-graph of time series for the above summaries (matplotlib)
-correlation grid for pairs of requested variables (heatmap? matplotlib)
